Welcome!
========

Welcome to ExtendedXMLSerializer's GitHub Repository.  Here you will find a .NET serializer that features a powerful extension model and works in the tried-and-trusted dependable XML format. üíñ

Why ExtendedXmlSerializer?  Classic `System.Xml.XmlSerializer` poses some challenges:

-   Does not support properties that are defined with interface types
-   Does not support read-only collection properties (like Xaml does)
-   Does not support parameterized constructors (immutable objects)
-   Does not support private constructors
-   Does not support serialization of class with circular reference or class with interface property
-   If you want create custom serializer, your class must inherit from `IXmlSerializable` or `ISerializable`. 
    This takes the "plain" out of [POCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_CLR_object). üòÅ
-   No migration mechanism for XML based on older code

ExtendedXmlSerializer addresses a lot of these problems and much much more!

-   Serializes and deserializes pretty much any POCO you throw at it: `class`, `struct`, generics, primitives, generic `List` and `Dictionary`, `Array`, `Enum` and much much more! If you find a class that doesn't get serialized, [let us know](https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/home/issues/new) and we'll take a look at it.
    - Yes, this even and especially means classes with property interface! 
-   Custom serializer registration by type or member
-   Serialization of references, handling circular references without endlessly looping
-   All configurations (migrations, custom serializer...) are outside the class and not coupled to attributes or messy, arcane conventions
-   Migrate old XML based on an older schema to a current schema
-   Property encryption
-   Support `XmlElementAttribute`, `XmlRootAttribute`, and `XmlTypeAttribute` for identity resolution
-   Additional attribute support: `XmlIgnoreAttribute`, `XmlAttributeAttribute`, and `XmlEnumAttribute`
-   Deserialization xml from classic `XmlSerializer` (mostly, [details in FAQ](https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/home/wiki/FAQs#systemxmlserializer-vs-extendedxmlserializer))

Supported platforms:
