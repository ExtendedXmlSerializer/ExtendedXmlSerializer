General Information
===================

Support platforms:

- .NET Standard 2.0
- .NET 4.5 ([for now](https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/ExtendedXmlSerializer/issues/273))

Feature overview:

-   Deserialization xml from classic `XmlSerializer` (mostly, see: <https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/ExtendedXmlSerializer/issues/240>)
-   Serialization class, struct, generic class, primitive type, generic
    list and dictionary, array, enum
-   Serialization class with property interface
-   Serialization circular reference and reference Id
-   Migrate old XML based on an older schema to a current schema.
-   Property encryption
-   Custom serializer
-   Support `XmlElementAttribute`, `XmlRootAttribute`, and `XmlTypeAttribute` for identity resolution
-   Additional attribute support: `XmlIgnoreAttribute`, `XmlAttributeAttribute`, and `XmlEnumAttribute`
-   POCO - all configurations (migrations, custom serializer...) are outside the class and not coupled to attributes or arcane conventions

Standard XML Serializer in .NET is very limited:

-   Does not support serialization of class with circular reference or class with interface property
-   There is no mechanism for reading the old version of XML
-   Does not support properties that are defined with interface types
-   Does not support read-only collection properties (like Xaml does)
-   Does not support parameterized constructors
-   Does not support private constructors
-   If you want create custom serializer, your class must inherit from `IXmlSerializable` or `ISerializable`. 
    This takes the "plain" out of [POCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_CLR_object). üòÅ
